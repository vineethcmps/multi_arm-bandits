Code is self explanatory and is well commented

To run epsilon greedy algorithm:

	$ python eps_greedy.py 

	This will generate plots after the simulation. (Close each plot to get the subsequent plots)
 
To run UCB algorithm:

	$ python UCB.py

	This will generate plots after the simulation. (Close each plot to get the subsequent plots)
